Adult Mortality Prediction with Simple Linear Regression
Overview
This project predicts adult mortality using simple linear regression. It’s a straightforward model built to understand the relationship between different factors and mortality rates.

The Model
I used Simple Linear Regression to predict mortality rates. To evaluate how well the model performs, I checked the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score (which tells how much of the variance in mortality rates is explained by the model).

Data
The dataset includes different features related to adult health and living conditions. The idea was to see how well we can predict mortality based on these factors.

Results
The model performance was assessed using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE) – A lower score means better predictions.
R² Score – This helps to understand how much of the variance in the data is captured by the model (closer to 1 is better).
